# reactPortfolio

The plan is to construct myself a new Portfolio webpage using React.js.
This web page will consist of components ( Wrapper, Main Wrapper, Sub Wrapper, and its child components displayed below.

The Main Wrapper will serve as the largest and main component to house the About and Project Display.

   The About Component will display information regarding my training and work experience in Software and Web Development.

   The Project Display Component will display a preview of my completed projects with a onClick Function to direct you to that projects github repository.
   
   
The Sub Wrapper will serve to house my Name and Contact info & Skills/Languages.
   
   The name component will house my Name, and contact information/ as well as onclick functions to redirect you to my pages of interest.
   
   The Skills and Languages component will simply house a brief list of my profiecient skills and languages.
